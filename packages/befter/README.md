# Befter

[`befter`](https://farming-labs.vercel.app/docs/befter) is a lightweight library for managing hooks in JavaScript. It allows you to register hooks, invoke them in a sequence, and manage hook updates. You can also set up hooks before or after other hooks to control the execution flow.

## Step 1: Install Befter via NPM

To install `befter`, you'll need to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager), which is typically installed along with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you haven't installed Node.js and npm yet, you can do so by downloading and installing the latest version of Node.js from their official website.

Once Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command in your project directory:

Installing using npm

```bash
npm install @farming-labs/befter
```

Using it in your app

```bash
import { createBefter } from "@farming-labs/befter"
```

Go and refer to the [Usage](https://farming-labs.vercel.app/docs/befter/usage) section to learn how to use Befter.
